# toilets-UP229
 Group repo for our research project on public toilets

To Doo-doo List:

- Make a data folder and start throwing data in
- Make our own notebooks and start doing exploratory analysis
- Set dates when we should meet
- Set deadlines when we hope to have things done
	
## Midterm Directions:
### We're presenting during Week 6 - May 4, 2022
- These are informal presentations - give your peers a sense of what you are working on and what techniques you are using. It's a chance to cross-fertilize ideas and help each other out
- Keep to 4 minutes maximum - 2-3 minutes is fine. Not everyone in your group needs to speak if that would take up too much time
- You can use slides or show a notebook or just talk without visual aids
