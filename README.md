### Research Question:
WIP

### Data Sources:
- **LACAN's Handwashing Station** [Link](http://skidrowpower.com/handwashing/)
The Los Angeles Community Action Network (LACAN) is a social service and advocacy agency working to organize and empower downtown and South Central L.A. residents dealing with poverty. Their map is built on top of the geocoded data from LAHSA. We were able to download this data as a KML file, then convert it into a CSV that's more useful for our purposes.

- **LA Parks**[Link]()
We are still working to either scrape this information from the Parks website or to pull and clean data from the LA Open Data Portal.

-**LA Public Libraries** [Link]()
We are still working to wrangle data either from the County Library API or the City's Open Data Portal.
